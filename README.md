# Interaksjonsdesign tema 8: Applikasjonsutvikling
This repo supports the <b>Application development</b> course at Interaction Design, HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania, spring 2020. Subjects and excercises are ongoingly submitted from the teaching staff. 

## How to use
As a student, first <b>clone</b> the repo to your local machine. The easiest way to do this, is to use the green button on the right hand side of the repo frontpage, and choose 'open in desktop' (you need <a href='https://desktop.github.com/'>github desktop</a> installed). You now have a personal copy of the repo on your local machine. 

At any point you can choose to <b>pull</b> the repo (in github desktop it's called 'fetch origin') from the remote, to get the files. If you accidentally change or remove files from the repo and wish to get back to the original version, just delete your local copy and clone the repo again.  

The repo is <b>not</b> intended as scaffolding for personal work - since you are not able to push your own changes to it. It's basically just a bunch of examples from the online classes. If you wish to use the examples as a starting point for your own work, just copy any project into a personal folder.
